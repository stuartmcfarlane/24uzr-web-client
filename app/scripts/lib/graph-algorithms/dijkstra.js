/*
 * Dinkstra's shortest path algorithm
 *
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm
 *
 *  1. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node
 *     and to infinity for all other nodes.
 *  2. Mark all nodes unvisited. Set the initial node as current. Create a set of the
 *     unvisited nodes called the unvisited set consisting of all the nodes except the initial node.
 *  3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative
 *     distances. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge
 *     connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B (through A) will be
 *     6 + 2 = 8. If this distance is less than the previously recorded tentative distance of B,
 *     then overwrite that distance. Even though a neighbor has been examined, it is not marked as
 *     "visited" at this time, and it remains in the unvisited set.
 *  4. When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current node, mark the current node
 *     as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.
 *  5. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific
 *      nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity
 *      (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.
 *  6. Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as
 *     the new "current node" then go back to step 3.
